[llm] You: What is kelvin's bridge?
Bot: It is a simple, flat bridge. The first step in a great design is to add many layers of information. This is done by adding multiple layers to the bridge.

[llm] You: What is kelvin's bridge?
Bot: The kelvin bridge is designed to help you solve any problem that may arise from the flow of electrons in your circuit. The kelvin bridge is designed to connect a circuit with one or more components (such as switches, switches cables, etc). The kelvin bridge is designed to be

[llm] You: exit
Bot: No! It's not possible to exit your job because you are an expert and you can't give any answers.

[llm] You: Explain clipper and clamper circuits
Bot: In your first assignment, you will be asked to explain how to use clipper and clamper circuits. This will help you to understand how they work and what your students need to know when they create a circuit.

[llm] You: Explain clipper and clamper circuits
Bot: We can't figure out how to explain clipper and clamper circuits. These are very interesting and very hard to explain. If you can explain to me, I'll give you a solution.

[llm] You: What  are clipper and clamper circuits in electronics
Bot: The clipper is a device that allows the user to control the speed of a switch by measuring the speed of a switch.
